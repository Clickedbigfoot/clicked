<h1>Welcome!</h1>
A website for me to show off and share my stuff :)
<h2>Here are some of my projects I've been working on</h2>
<h3>Scribbl.io Custom Preparer</h3>
<p class="code desc">This is a python project I made for those that want to let their friends make lists of custom words for the popular game 
<a href="skribbl.io">skribbl.io</a>.
<ul>
<li>You can find my original python script 
<a href="https://github.com/Clickedbigfoot/skribblIOCustomPrep">here</a></li>
</ul>
I figured since my friends don't necessarily sit down together to generate our custom words, it was pretty useful to instead make a quick and easy way to combine our own lists into a single, combined, and succinct copy-and-paste-able paragraph for the game.</p>
