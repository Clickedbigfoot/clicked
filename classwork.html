<h1>Assignments!</h1>
Not all assignments are public, but some of them are and I don't see any reason to keep them hidden
<h3>Machine Translation Class</h3>
<p>During my machine translation class, we were tasked with researching the current state of the art techniques for machine translation and recreating our own system. Below is a link to the paper I wrote relating to that translation system that I built.

<h3>Introductory Computer Science Class</h3>
<p>These are assignments from the first cs course taken at my uni, so they're pretty simple in terms of the contribution expected from us students.
