<p class="content">You ever hear the phrase "Life ends when you're 22"? It is with great triste and a heavy heart that we gather on this web page today to remember our dear friend John Moreno. He lived a great life and was a dependable hombre. After growing up in the rich, 3rd-world dystopia that is known globally as the United States of America, he had an arduous life. Yet despite all that, he still shared his kind smile with us all, like a smile-oriented philanthropist, such as Steve Jobs (Who is also dead FYI). When I met John, he had earned the name "Freaky Fast"; this was because he was super freaking fast at his job bussing in the elite dining hall known as Dish. It was quite a warzone and tbh people who work "dish night" are braver than the US marines, but you know who was the bravest of them all? John. It was comforting knowing that no matter how busy it got, he would have our backs (Except of course one night where he had an exam or something, but no one noticed he wasn't there so dish room got all backed up at the end because no one filled in for busser the entire shift and doux jesus that was a fucking horrible night). And wow, he had a soothing voice. Not jazz smooth, but like podcast smooth, yeah? Anyways, we will all miss our dear friend and perhaps someday we will be able to chill with him in heaven, as that is definitely where he will reside for eternity. For you sinners though, you probably won't meet him because you're all going to hell, js, I don't make the rules.</p>
