<h1>Diary of M Audrey</h1>
<h4>A new opportunity</h4>
<p>The portal was finished today! As it turns out, we had correctly restored the shape of the structure, but something the ruins didn't give indication of was the final ingredient: fire. Tarlene was messing around again with the flint and stone and accidentally set fire to the portal. I'm told the flames were instantly sucked up before the portal exuded some purple, translucent haze. After standing in it for just a moment, it sent us to some hellish dimension. Is this the Nether we have read about?</p>
<h4>Blazes</h4>
<p>There is a surprisingly diverse world here! Fantastic creatures, some of them are even civilized. Others, unfortunately, were not so eager to interact nicely. One combustible monster in particular attacked me with fireballs. Disposing of the creature was a trivial matter for someone like me, but it dropped a rod oozing with magic. Perhaps the creature has some use besides being a nuisance...</p>
<h4>Speed!</h4>
<p>We've been growing these little warts from the Nether for a while now. They require no water or nourishment other than sand imbued with tortured souls. I know it makes the others happy as an aesthetic, but I have a hunch that these warts can be useful. Consumable. Using a special brewing stand I made with the blaze rod, I mixed them with some water and a pinch of sugar to produce a beverage tingling with energy. I gulped it down and found myself temporarily able to run as fast as the wind! The others called me crazy, but I call them cowards. Look where that got them and this got me</p>
<h4>More combinations</h4>
<p>Now that the others have seen what these potions can do, they all want to copy me now. No matter, their eagerness cannot replicate my ambition. I have been busy mixing all manner of things and creating new potions. Many of the ingredients are rather intuitive. For example, mixing in a rabbit's foot creates a potion that enables me to jump high. A spider's eye turns the potion poisonous. A puffer fish, however, will grant the drinker the ability to even breathe underwater! Tarlene and her enchanted helmet are no longer necesary for water-breathing. With my ingenuity, we have made such a feat achievable by even the lowliest of witches</p>
<h4>Happy day!</h4>
<p>Nessa and I got into an argument. She was infatuated with this idea of mixing in multiple ingredients besides the netherwart, water, and special ingredient from which the potions draw their unique properties. I told her she was mad. I was a fool. After much experimentation, she made three discoveries: 1) adding a little redstone dust to potions extended their durations at the cost of their potency, 2) adding glowstone dust to a potion had the opposite effect, and 3) adding a fermented spider's eye corrupts the effect entirely! It's remarkable what she discovered, really</p>
<h4>A pity</h4>
<p>After much trial and error, I'm afraid that human essences do not have a place in the potion brewing art. Not as a base ingredient nor as an enhancer, it seems there is no magical property to derive from any part of a human. I'm glad Tarlene was a well nourished and built woman; otherwise, one life alone would have been insufficient a cost for this recent series of experiments</p>
<h4>Too much</h4>
<p>The others won't talk to me anymore. It's too much, they tell me. Their lack of drive is embarassing. I have travelled far and wide and compiled a list of items that I found useful to this potion brewing task. Someone had to get their hands dirty
	<ul>
		<li>Sugar</li>
		<li>Rabbit's foot</li>
		<li>Glistering melon slices</li>
		<li>Eyes of spiders</li>
		<li>Pufferfish</li>
		<li>Magma cream</li>
		<li>Golden carrot</li>
		<li>Blaze powder</li>
		<li>Tears of a ghast</li>
		<li>Turtle's shell</li>
		<li>Phantom membrane</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h4>GONE</h4>
<p>I don't understand why, but Guqqi seems to have become terrified of me lately. Surely, she knows I would never harm her, my loyal familiar, but she ran from me all the same. Maybe it was the beautiful, yellow glow of my eyes? I've noticed it recently in my reflection. Or the subtle, dark ooze from my pores. No matter, she chose to abandon me just like the rest of those witches. The path to divinity is a lonely one. Nevertheless, I have found a final piece to this puzzle. Adding a pinch of gunpouder seems to allow these potions to be propelled forward with incredible velocity. Before, these potions were merely enhancers; now, they can be exertions of my power, whether the person afflicted with its effects is willing or not. I think I will share with the others what I have just discovered. I think I will have fun doing so, too</p>
<h4>Sad</h4>
<p>I thought I'd be happier by now. These potions give me so much power, and everyone and everything that gets in my way simply melts now. I'm immortal! I'm divine! Except... I'm not? Are these potions enough? Is there more I can achieve? Perhaps I need elements from creatures more my level, like this wither monster I keep hearing about. I'm not too... sure. I'll do it. If not that, then what else would I do? Thank you diary for always listening. You've been so encouraging when no one else has. I'll log my results shortly
