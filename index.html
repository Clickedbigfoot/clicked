<h1>Welcome!</h1>
A website for me to show off and share my stuff :)
<h2>Here are some of my projects I've been working on</h2>
<h3>Automatic Class Signup</h3>
<p class="code desc">Since my classes in my university were competitive and often full, I created this program to automatically sign me up for the courses as soon as someone dropped their spot and opened a seat up for grabs.
<ul>
	<li>You can find my original python script <a href="https://github.com/Clickedbigfoot/SignupEZ">here</a></li>
	<li>You can find my windows executable <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jg0OZ3BX7hI-Gp4ZzZ-qRyl75NobkbNJ/view?usp=sharing">here</a>, intended for Windows 10 64-bit computers (4/1/2020)</li>
</ul>
I initially used Selenium with Python to accomplish this task. It actually worked so well that I was able to get into all the classes I wanted! Eventually, I also reimplemented it in C# using .Net Core and compiled it for Windows so that I could let my closer friends benefit from my efforts, too.</p>
<h3>Advanced Electricity Management</h3>
<p class="code desc">Comed offers an hourly electricity pricing plan. Using the strategies outlined <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/hacking-your-comed-electricity-bill/111494">here</a> by a friendly stranger on the internet, I'm hoping to take advantage of it to the max for my own home.
<ul>
	<li>You can find my github repository <a href="https://github.com/Clickedbigfoot/ComedHourly">here</a></li>
</ul>
The goal right now is to reimplement his design in a way that works for my house. I also want to take this further and eventually use machine learning, perhaps with extra features such as the weather and temperature, to improve upon the original. However, I must first collect more data before I can complete that goal. This repository currently scrapes that data into a csv file for future use.</p>
<h3>Scribbl.io Custom Preparer</h3>
<p class="code desc">This is a python project I made for those that want to let their friends make lists of custom words for the popular game 
<a href="https://skribbl.io">skribbl.io</a>.
<ul>
	<li>You can find my original python script <a href="https://github.com/Clickedbigfoot/skribblIOCustomPrep">here</a></li>
	<li>You can find my windows executable <a href="./downloadables/skribblio.zip" download>here</a>, intended for Windows 10 64-bit computers (6/3/2020)</li>
</ul>
I figured since my friends don't necessarily sit down together to generate our custom words, it was pretty useful to instead make a quick and easy way to combine our own lists into a single, combined, and succinct copy-and-paste-able paragraph for the game.</p>
<h3>A Discord Bot</h3>
<p class="code desc">This is a (at the time) working discord bot made from python. It's primarily a music bot, but it has a lot of other possible features, some built into it by the original maker and some added by me. Since it's very old and I was very new to it (This was both my introduction to python and my first step away from IDEs), this is probably an obsolete relic, but here it is nevertheless.<br>
The original maker was named AsexualRhino.

</ul></p>
<h3>A Group Chat Simulator</h3>
<p class="code desc">Incomplete, but the end goal is to have a bunch of AI trained on the messages sent in a discord group chat I'm in, and then put the AI in a group chat on their own and see how they talk to each other. So far, I have a python script for extracting all the messages along with their dates, times, and authors.
