<h1>Welcome!</h1>
A website for me to show off and share
<h2>Here are some of my projects I've been working on</h2>
<h3>Textstat</h3>
<p class="code desc">Textstat is an open source project that aims to provide an easy to use Python package for automatically assessing statistics and readability scores for various texts.
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/shivam5992/textstat">Github repository</a>, which is in the process of moving. Last updated 9/8/2021</li>
</ul>
My contributions include styling corrections at the request of the maintainers as well as implementing new features and debugging existing ones.</p>
<h3>Automatic Class Signup</h3>
<p class="code desc">Since my classes in my university were competitive and often full, I created this program to automatically sign me up for the courses as soon as someone dropped their spot and opened a seat up for grabs.
<ul>
	<li>You can find my original python script <a href="https://github.com/Clickedbigfoot/SignupEZ">here</a></li>
	<li>You can find my windows executable <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jg0OZ3BX7hI-Gp4ZzZ-qRyl75NobkbNJ/view?usp=sharing">here</a>, intended for Windows 10 64-bit computers (4/1/2020)</li>
</ul>
I initially used Selenium with Python to accomplish this task. It actually worked so well that it had a 100% success rate getting me into my desired classes. Eventually, I also reimplemented it in C# using .Net Core and compiled it for Windows so that I could let my peers benefit from this, too.</p>
<h3>Advanced Electricity Management</h3>
<p class="code desc">Comed offers an hourly electricity pricing plan. Using the strategies outlined <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/hacking-your-comed-electricity-bill/111494">here</a>, I'm hoping to take advantage of it to the max for my own home.
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/Clickedbigfoot/ComedHourly">Link to Github repository</a></li>
</ul>
Currently, I have built a system that effectively scrapes the data from online and utilizes it to make money saving predictions through machine learning. The data is stored in both a csv file and an SQL database. Moving forward with this project, my next goal is to have my system interface with a usb device to output an electrical signal when it makes its predictions. Later down the road, I'd also like to revisit the machine learning models and see if their performance can be enhanced even further once more data has been collected; currently, due to how long this project has been going, the data for training and testing is suboptimal.</p>
<h3>Scribbl.io Custom Preparer</h3>
<p class="code desc">This is a python project I made for those that want to let their friends make lists of custom words for the popular game 
<a href="https://skribbl.io">skribbl.io</a>. It's not a fancy program, but just a quick script I coded on the fly
<ul>
	<li>You can find my original python script <a href="https://github.com/Clickedbigfoot/skribblIOCustomPrep">here</a></li>
	<li>You can find my windows executable <a href="./downloadables/skribblio.zip" download>here</a>, intended for Windows 10 64-bit computers (6/3/2020)</li>
</ul>
I figured since people don't necessarily sit down together to generate our custom words, it was pretty useful to instead make a quick and easy way to combine their independent lists into a single, combined, and succinct copy-and-paste-able paragraph for the game.</p>
